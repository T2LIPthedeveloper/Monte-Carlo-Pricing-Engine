# Monte Carlo Pricing Engine

A high-performance options pricing engine using C++ and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) simulations. Designed for **speed, efficiency, and robustness**, with support for **multithreading, logging, CSV export, and CI/CD**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** for realistic asset price modeling.
- **Multithreading** for faster simulations.
- **Logging with `spdlog`** for better debugging.
- **CSV import/export** for data handling.
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Linux, Mac, Windows).
- **Dockerized build & deployment** with multi-stage optimization.
- **Unit tests with GoogleTest** (`gtest`).
- **Continuous Integration (CI) ready**.

## 🖥️ Usage

### **CLI Mode**
```sh
./monte_carlo
```
**Example Input:**
```
Enter spot price (S0): 100
Enter strike price (K): 110
Enter risk-free rate (r): 0.05
Enter volatility (sigma): 0.2
Enter time to expiration (T in years): 1
Enter number of simulations: 100000
Enter option type (c for Call, p for Put): c
```
**Example Output:**
```
Monte Carlo Option Price: 7.89
```

### **Export to CSV**
```sh
./monte_carlo --export results.csv
```
